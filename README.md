# **Optimized Computer Vision System for Worker Activity Monitoring**

This project provides a real-time computer vision system to monitor worker activity using a video stream or RTSP input. The system is built with Python 3.8, powered by [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), and has been tested on an RTX 4060 (8GB) GPU.
